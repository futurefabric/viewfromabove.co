The View from Above
===================

The View from Above is a small self-initiated project to pull together photographs tweeted by astronauts aboard the [International Space Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station)

It’s a work in progress, but can be viewed in its current state here —

It’s a Rails app, dependent mainly on the [Twitter gem](https://github.com/sferik/twitter) by [sferik](https://github.com/sferik). Currently it pulls in images using Twitter’s API. The longer term plan is to scrape the images, copy them locally and hook the data into a database so I can organise the content more effectively and offer other ways to navigate and explore.

Help yourself if you want to have a poke about and have suggestions to make it better.
